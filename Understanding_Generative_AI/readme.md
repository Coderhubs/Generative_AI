## **What is Generative AI?**

Generative AI refers to AI systems that are capable of creating new content such as text, images, music, or code, based on patterns learned from existing data. These models generate novel outputs that closely mimic human-created content.

### Key Features:
- **Text Generation**: Models like GPT can generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
- **Image Creation**: AI like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) can create realistic images based on text or image data.
- **Music & Art**: Generative models can produce music and artwork.
- **Code Generation**: AI can assist in writing code for various applications.

## **Generative AI in Action**

Generative AI has numerous applications in multiple fields, including creative writing, image generation, music composition, and even business report generation. Prominent models include GPT for text generation, DALL-E for image generation, and Codex for code generation.
